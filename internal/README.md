# Challenges Internal

This is the folder that contains different helpers for the challenges that come as a part of LearnVue+. 

- `_templates` is a starting point to create new challenges with some of the testing and scaffolding already setup
- `packages/test-config` provides Vitest configurations for different environments. This is used to create consistent input/output/reporters for the challenges, allowing the LearnVue website to properly parse the output (which is JSON) to provide a better experience for the user.
